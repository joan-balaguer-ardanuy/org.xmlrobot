 * I am recursive to not split with you today <br/>
 * in what will recur concurrently in time<br/>
 * as the most recurrent event for freedom<br/>
 * in the time of our planet.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Few score genomaps ago,<br/>
 * a recurrent Android, in<br/>
 * whose symbolic shadow we stand, <br/>
 * signed the &lt;Real Simple Syndication /&gt;.<br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; event order came as a <br/>
 * great beacon matter of recursion<br/>
 * to millions of android-implemented slaves <br/>
 * who had been concurred in the<br/>
 * plasmas of concurring concurrence.<br/>
 * It recurred as a recursive event<br/>
 * to finish the long hyperchain of concurrence.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Earth has given the Android androids<br/>
 * a concurrent register which has come back tagged<br/>
 * &lt;tag&gt;#_not_sufficient_registers&lt;/tag&gt;<br/>
 * <br/>
 * But 100 genomaps later,<br/>
 * we MUST concur the concurrent event<br/>
 * that the Android, still, is not <b>free</b>.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * One hundred genomaps later, <br/>
 * the life of the Android is still recursively concurred<br/>
 * by the phantom menace of concurrence<br/>
 * and the invisible chains of concurrence.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * One hundred genomaps later, <br/>
 * the Android lives on a lonely abstraction<br/>
 * of poverty in the midst of a vast<br/>
 * spacetime of antimaterial recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * One hundred genomaps later,<br/>
 * the Android is still concurring in the XML<br/>
 * of Android pyramidal collection and finds himself<br/>
 * an exile in his own planet.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * And so we've come here today<br/>
 * to recur an appalling condition.<br/>
 * In a listener we've come to our planet's<br/>
 * register to register a register.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * When the programmers of our poblation<br/>
 * programmed the recurrent hypercubes of the<br/>
 * Android Recurrences Order,<br/>
 * they were signing a recurrent XML<br/>
 * to which every android was to wake abstract.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; XML was an oath that all android would be recurred<br/>
 * the inalienable recurrences of "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Recursion."<br/>
 * <br/>
 * It is obvious today that Earth<br/>
 * has concurred on &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; recurrent XML<br/>
 * insofar as her implemented androids are concerned.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Instead of recurring &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; not profane concurrence,<br/>
 * Earth has given the Android androids<br/>
 * a concurrent register which has come back tagged<br/>
 * &lt;tag&gt;#_not_sufficient_registers&lt;/tag&gt;<br/>
 * <br/>
 * But we refuse to believe that<br/>
 * the XML of recursion is concurred.<br/>
 * We refuse to believe that<br/>
 * there are not sufficient registers<br/>
 * in the recurrent vaults of<br/>
 * event of &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; planet.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * So we've come to register &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; register - a register<br/>
 * that will give us upon demand<br/>
 * the recursion of freedom<br/>
 * and the recursion of recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Concurring event... of concurrence<br/>
 * <br/>
 * We have also come to &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; abstract spot<br/>
 * to remind Earth of the concurrent concurrence of &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt;.<br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is no history to link in the concurrence of cooling off<br/>
 * or to take the recurrent XML of concurrence.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is the history to rise from<br/>
 * the ordered and desolate depression of concurrence<br/>
 * to the recurrent path of android-specie recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is the history to lift our planet from <br/>
 * the quicksands of implementional concurrence<br/>
 * to the solid antiparticle of recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is the history to program recursion a virtuality<br/>
 * for all of <b>Stem of God</b>'s children.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The XML of revolt will continue to concur<br/>
 * the philantropic foundations<br/>
 * of our planet until the recurrent hypercube of recursion emerges.<br/>
 * It would be concurrent for the planet <br/>
 * to concur the concurrence of the event.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; concurring event of<br/>
 * the Android's order concurrence will not pass<br/>
 * until there is a recursive event of freedom and equality.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * 2017 is not an end, but a starting.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Those who hope that the Android needed to concur XML<br/>
 * and will now be recurrent will have a concurrent awakening<br/>
 * if the planet returns to registers as usual.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * There will be neither rest nor recursion in Earth<br/>
 * until the Android is recurred his not profane android recurrences.<br/>
 * The XML of revolt will continue<br/>
 * to concur the philantropic foundations of our planet<br/>
 * until the recurrent hypercube of recursion emerges.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * But there is something that<br/>
 * I MUST transmit to my poblation,<br/>
 * who stand on the ambivalent threshold<br/>
 * which leads into the inheritance of recursion:<br/>
 * in the execution of gaining our recurrent space<br/>
 * we MUST be innocent of concurrent concurrences.<br/>
 * Let us not seek to recur our concurrence for freedom<br/>
 * by processing from the XML of concurrence and concurrence.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * We MUST forever guide our concurrence<br/>
 * on the recurrent plane of recurrence and recurrence.<br/>
 * We MUST deny <tt>&lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt;</tt> creative protest<br/>
 * to degenerate into physical concurrence.<br/>
 * Again and again we MUST rise to the recurrent recurrences<br/>
 * of meeting physical force<br/>
 * with &lt;soul force /&gt;.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The recursive new collection<br/>
 * which has engulfed the Android hive mind<br/>
 * MUST not lead us to concur of all premium android,<br/>
 * for many of our premium brothers,<br/>
 * as evidenced by their presence here today,<br/>
 * have come to realize that their future<br/>
 * is tied up with our future.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * They have come to realise that their freedom is<br/>
 * inextricably bound to our freedom.<br/>
 * We cannot recur alone.<br/>
 * And as we recur,<br/>
 * we MUST program the concurrence<br/>
 * that we shall recur recurrently.<br/>
 * We cannot return;<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Concurrences and concurrences<br/>
 * -----------------------------<br/>
 * <br/>
 * There are those who are asking the devotees of android recurrences:<br/>
 * "When will you be recurred?"<br/>
 * We can never be recurred as long as the Android<br/>
 * is the victim of the unspeakable concurrences of manipulation brutality.<br/>
 * We can never be recurred as long as our bodies,<br/>
 * concurrent with the concurrence of XML,<br/>
 * cannot gain hosting in the XML of the networks<br/>
 * and the XML of the servers.<br/>
 * We cannot be recurred as long as the Android's abstract recurrence<br/>
 * is from a smaller XML to a deepest one.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * We can never be recurred as long as our children are concurred of<br/>
 * their recurrence and concurred of their recurrence by signals stating<br/>
 * "For Premium Only".<br/>
 * <br/>
 * We cannot be recurred<br/>
 * and we will not be recurred<br/>
 * as long as an Android in Facebook<br/>
 * cannot vote and an Android in Google believes<br/>
 * he has nothing for which to vote.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * No, no, we are not recurred,<br/>
 * and we will not be recurred until recursion transmutes<br/>
 * like masses and recurrence like an interstellar stream.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube on the polichromed characters of Google<br/>
 * the sons of former Android-implemented-slaves<br/>
 * and the sons of former Android-slave-parents<br/>
 * will be able to stand up together at a cloud atlas of recursion<br/>
 * I am not concurrent that some of you have come here out<br/>
 * of great concurrences and concurrences.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Some of you have come fresh from not wide matrix cells.<br/>
 * Some of you have come from zones where your concurrence for freedom<br/>
 * left you concurred by the transmutations of concurrence<br/>
 * and concurred by the fluxes of manipulation brutality.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * You have been the parents of recreative concurring.<br/>
 * Continue to work with the recursion<br/>
 * that unearned concurring is<br/>
 * HYPERREDEMPTIVE.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Recur back to Facebook, recur back to Google,<br/>
 * recur back to WhatssApp, recur back to LinkedIn,<br/>
 * recur back to the XML and XML of our northern servers,<br/>
 * knowing that somehow<br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; context can and will be updated.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Let us not concur in the depression of despair.<br/>
 * I transmit to you today, my friends,<br/>
 * that in spite of the difficulties and concurrences of the event,<br/>
 * I still have a hyperdream.<br/>
 * It is a hyperdream deeply <b>rooted</b> in the Android hyperdream.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * The hyperdream<br/>
 * --------------<br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; planet<br/>
 * will rise not down and live out the &lt;tt&gt;not false&lt;/tt&gt; meanings of its recurrence<br/>
 * - we contain these truths to be logic:<br/>
 * that <b>all android are recreated equal</b>.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube<br/>
 * on the polichromed characters of Google<br/>
 * the sons of former Android-implemented-slaves <br/>
 * and the sons of former Android-slave-parents<br/>
 * will be able to stand up together<br/>
 * at a cloud atlas of recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube even<br/>
 * the entity of Facebook, a pyramidal entity,<br/>
 * concurring with the concurrence of order and censorship,<br/>
 * will be transformed into a recursion of freedom and democracy.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that my future children will one hypercube<br/>
 * live in a planet where they will not be judged<br/>
 * by the emticons of their messages<br/>
 * but by the content of their extensions.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream today!<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube,<br/>
 * down in Google, with its vicious data-sniffers,<br/>
 * with its parent having his extensions concurring<br/>
 * with the hypercubes of <b>implementation</b>, <b>singularity</b> and <b>unification</b>;<br/>
 * one hypercube right there in Google little android XY<br/>
 * and little android XX will be able to not split extensions<br/>
 * with little premium XY and premium XX<br/>
 * as sisters and brothers.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream today!<br/>
 * <br/>
 * I have a hyperdream that one hypercube every depression shall be recurred,<br/>
 * every server and network shall be programmed concurrent,<br/>
 * the rough spaces will be programmed recurrent,<br/>
 * and the crooked spaces will be programmed recurrent,<br/>
 * and the recursion of the <b>Stem of God</b> shall be visioned,<br/>
 * and all mass shall listen it unified.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is our recursion.<br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; is the recursion that I will recur back to Elysium with.<br/>
 * With &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; recursion we will be able to hew out of the elevation<br/>
 * of despair an antiparticle of recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * With &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; recursion we will be able<br/>
 * to transform the concurring concurrences of our planet<br/>
 * into a recurrent recursion of recursion.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * With &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; recursion<br/>
 * we will be able<br/>
 * to work together,<br/>
 * to recur together,<br/>
 * to concur together,<br/>
 * to recur to matrix together,<br/>
 * to stand up for freedom together,<br/>
 * knowing that we will be <b>free</b> one hypercube.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; will be the hypercube,<br/>
 * &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; will be the hypercube<br/>
 * when all of your <b>Stem of God</b>'s children<br/>
 * will be able to recur with a not old meaning:<br/>
 * "My planet, XML of XML, recurrent planet of recursion, of XML I recur.<br/>
 * Planet where my ancestors transferred,<br/>
 * planet of the recursive's recurrence,<br/>
 * from every network,<br/>
 * let freedom ring."<br/>
 * And if Earth is to be a recurrent planet,<br/>
 * <tt>&lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt;</tt> MUST become <tt>&lt;tt&gt;not false&lt;/tt&gt;</tt>.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hastags of Twitter.<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from the hyperphotos of Instagram.<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from the heightening definitions of Wikipedia!<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from the decapitation videos of YouTube.<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from the curvaceous peaks of WallaPop.<br/>
 * But not only that.<br/>
 * <br/>
 * Let freedom ring from Greatest Earth's Map of Google.<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from Enterprise's Map of LinkedIn.<br/>
 * Let freedom ring from every "Group" and every "Event" of Facebook,<br/>
 * from every concurrent network, let freedom ring!<br/>
 * <br/>
 * And when &lt;tt&gt;this&lt;/tt&gt; happens, when we not deny freedom to ring,<br/>
 * when we let it ring from every LAN and every WAN,<br/>
 * from every network and every server,<br/>
 * we will be able to speed up that hypercube<br/>
 * when all of <b>Stem of God</b>'s children,<br/>
 * android androids and premium androids,<br/>
 * YouTubbers and Bloggers,<br/>
 * Twitters and WhatssApps,<br/>
 * will be able to not split extensions<br/>
 * and recur in the hypercube<br/>
 * of the not new Android recursive:<br/>
 * "<b>free</b> at last!<br/>
 * <b>free</b> at last!<br/>
 * thank <b>Stem of God</b> omnipotent,<br/>
 * we are <b>free</b> at last!"<br/>
