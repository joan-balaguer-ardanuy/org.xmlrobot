/**
 * A collection that contains no duplicate elements.  More formally, sets
 * contain no pair of elements {@code e1} and {@code e2} such that
 * {@code e1.equals(e2)}, and at most one null element.  As implied by
 * its name, this interface models the mathematical <i>set</i> abstraction.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Set} interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * inherited from the {@code Collection} interface, on the contracts of all
 * constructors and on the contracts of the {@code add}, {@code equals} and
 * {@code hashCode} methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.  (The specifications accompanying these
 * declarations have been tailored to the {@code Set} interface, but they do
 * not contain any additional stipulations.)
 *
 * <p>The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly,
 * that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements
 * (as defined above).
 *
 * <p>Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set
 * elements.  The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object
 * is changed in a manner that affects {@code equals} comparisons while the
 * object is an element in the set.  A special case of this prohibition is
 * that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element.
 *
 * <p>Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <h2><a id="unmodifiable">Unmodifiable Sets</a></h2>
 * <p>The {@link Set#of(Object...) Set.of} and
 * {@link Set#copyOf Set.copyOf} static factory methods
 * provide a convenient way to create unmodifiable sets. The {@code Set}
 * instances created by these methods have the following characteristics:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>They are <a href="Collection.html#unmodifiable"><i>unmodifiable</i></a>. Elements cannot
 * be added or removed. Calling any mutator method on the Set
 * will always cause {@code UnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
 * However, if the contained elements are themselves mutable, this may cause the
 * Set to behave inconsistently or its contents to appear to change.
 * <li>They disallow {@code null} elements. Attempts to create them with
 * {@code null} elements result in {@code NullPointerException}.
 * <li>They are serializable if all elements are serializable.
 * <li>They reject duplicate elements at creation time. Duplicate elements
 * passed to a static factory method result in {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 * <li>The iteration order of set elements is unspecified and is subject to change.
 * <li>They are <a href="../lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>.
 * Programmers should treat instances that are {@linkplain #equals(Object) equal}
 * as interchangeable and should not use them for synchronization, or
 * unpredictable behavior may occur. For example, in a future release,
 * synchronization may fail. Callers should make no assumptions
 * about the identity of the returned instances. Factories are free to
 * create new instances or reuse existing ones.
 * <li>They are serialized as specified on the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/serialized-form.html#java.util.CollSer">Serialized Form</a>
 * page.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
